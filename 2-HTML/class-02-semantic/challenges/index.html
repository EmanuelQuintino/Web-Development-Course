          <p>
            'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <br />
            Not knowing what it was <br />
            I will not give you up this time <br />
            But darling, just kiss me slow <br />
            Your heart is all I own <br />
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine

          <h2>Refrão</h2>
          <p>
            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark <br />
            With you between my arms <br />
            Barefoot on the grass <br />
            Listening to our favourite song <br />
            When you said you looked a mess <br />
            I whispered underneath my breath <br />
            But you heard it <br />
            Darling, you look perfect tonight

            Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know <br />
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home <br />
            I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets <br />
            To carry love, to carry children of our own

            Fighting against all odds <br />
            I know we'll be alright this time <br />
            Darling, just hold my hand <br />
            Be my girl, I'll be your man <br />
            I see my future in your eyes

            With you between my arms <br />
            Barefoot on the grass <br />
            Listening to our favorite song <br />
            When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful <br />
            I don't deserve this <br />

            With you between my arms <br />
            Barefoot on the grass <br />
            Listening to our favorite song <br />
            I have faith in what I see <br />
            Now I know I have met an angel in person <br />
            And she looks perfect <br />
          </p>
