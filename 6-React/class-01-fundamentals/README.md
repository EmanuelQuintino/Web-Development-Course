# Class 01 Fundamentals

- Introduction

  - React Library
  - Render Interfaces

    - SPA and SSR are ways of rendering content, also known as Rendering Patterns.

    - SSR is when the Browser communicates with the Back-end and it returns the ready page content (HTML, CSS, JS).

    - SPA is when the Browser communicates with the Back-end and returns the data necessary for the client to render the page, normally in a format common to multiple platforms (JSON). This way, the same JSON can be used to render a page in the Browser using ReactJS and a screen in iOS/Android applications using React Native, for example.

- Installation

  - node.js
  - npm create vite@latest
  - typescript template

- Syntax
  - default/named exports
  - public/assets folder
  - JSX = JS + HTML
